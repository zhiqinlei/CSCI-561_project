homework of CSCI-561 class in 2020 fall

You will write a program that will take an input file that describes the maze configuration, the
initial entrance grid location, the exit grid location, and characteristics of the agent. You should
find the optimal path from the initial entrance grid location to that exit grid location. A path is
composed of a sequence of legal moves. Each legal move consists of moving the agent from a
point to one of its 18 neighbor points, using one of the elementary actions that are available at
the current location.
Your agent must search through possible paths of movements and find the optimal path to
travel from the entrance to the exit, and then output the results.
To find the solution you will use the following algorithms:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Uniform-cost search (UCS)
- A* search (A*).
